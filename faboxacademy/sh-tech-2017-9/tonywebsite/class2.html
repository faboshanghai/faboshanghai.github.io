          <h1>3D with rihno</h1>
          <p>In this class we have learned how to use rihno to design on 2D space.Actually, rihno is also can be designed on 3D space, but this is the next class content.</p>
          <img src = "class2pic1.JPG" width = "450px" height ="300px">
          <img src = "class2pic2.JPG" width ="450px" height = "280px">          
          <p style = "color:black;font-family:inherit;font-size: 17px; margin-left: 50px" > These are two examples for designing, though these are a little bit ugly. Rihno is a strong software. However, some precise measurements are necessary before designing, or the piece will not be satisfying.
              
              
              <p>And then we start learning how to use the laser cutter. There are three very important aspects.
                <li>1.Open the excape-pipe</li>
                <li>2.Open the laser cutter</li>
                <li>3.Open the laser switch</li>
            The reason why these are very important is that these three attentions ensure the safety of people and the safety of machine. Besides, before the article being printed, the settings should be tested,just like <img src = "class2pic5.jpg" width = "300px" height = "200px">
             Different settings meet different situation.</p>
            <img src = "class2pic3.jpg" width = "250px" height = "200px">
          <p>This is final product, very simple but I love it ~</p>
          
          <h>Questions</h>
          <p style = "color:black;font-family:inherit;font-size: 17px; margin-left: 50px" >However, when I do this project. I actually meet some problem about Carol draw. Previous designing software is rihno, but we need to transport the file to the Carol Draw. After doing that, I see that my design will be changed because I use different software to open it.</p>
