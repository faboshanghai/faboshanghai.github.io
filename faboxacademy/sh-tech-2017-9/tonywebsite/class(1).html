          <h1>The design and making of a website</h1>
          <p>What I learned in this class is firstly the definition of FABLAB.</p>
          <p style = "color: coral;font-family:monospace;font-size: 17px">The main idea of the FABLAB is to make everything in almost everywhere. The FABLAB will provide many prohibitive devices to users. However, there is still a serious problem that less people know how to use these facilities such as Laser cutter, 3D Scanner. Therefore, the manager of every FABLAB will teach the user how to hand these devices so that they can control these machines by themselves. Then, we saw many creative things made in the FABLAB.</p>
          <p style = "color: coral;font-family:monospace;font-size: 17px">What's more, we have been taught that each course and settings should be recorded in the website. Thus, we learn that how to make a website by adopting HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
          <p style = "color: coral;font-family:monospace;font-size: 17px">if you want to know about FABO and how to make a website, there are exact two materials on our home page.<a href="https://faboshanghai.github.io/material-sh-tech.html" target="_blank">FABO</a>
